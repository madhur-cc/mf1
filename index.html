							<h2>What is the challenge?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Modernity is extremely advantageous to humanity in many ways: electricity, internet, airplanes, pharmaceuticals and much more. However, the human biological design, like that of all other animals, still remains dominated by the ancient genome. While still holding/maintaining the same old biology we have made two critical changes in our lifestyle: we have become a lot more sedentary and spend more time indoors. This is probably  affecting /impacting the switching of many genes and thereby giving rise to various emotional and physiological ailments.

										<h3>Wilderness</h3>
										<p>
											
											In wilderness, we meet nature. To connect with nature is to connect with something beyond humans, of which we are a part.  </p>
										<code>
											“The clearest way into the Universe is through a forest wilderness.” - John Muir

										<br> <br>
										A growing body of research points to the beneficial effects that exposure to the natural world has on health, reducing stress and promoting healing. Present day policymakers, employers, and healthcare providers are increasingly giving consideration to the human need for nature in their plans and operations.

										"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains of life." - John Muir

										<h3>Homeostasis</h3>
										<p>Homeostasis refers to the capacity of the body to maintain the stability of diverse internal variables, such as temperature, acidity and water level, in the face of constant environmental disturbance.
										</p>
										<code>
											To return to homeostasis is to return home.
										</code>
										<br> <br>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<h3>How to work from home(ostasis)?</h3>
										<p>
											Is there an ideal state? More often than not we think in terms of ideal state and current state; we want to be ‘high’ - higher productivity, higher income, higher IQ, higher performance, high speed or higher state of being.

											<h3> It's 2021! Why hasn't life become as easy as they promised in the 90s?</h3>
											<p>
												Each year, a new product makes life even more physically convenient – thereby driving people more to the indoors and to a more sedentary life. At the same time, emotional and mood disorders have been increasing exponentially year on year. Conveniences tend  to weaken  body . Is poor physical fitness undercutting our emotional fitness?

	<br> <br>
	Here, they first provide points of consensus across the natural, social, and health sciences on the impacts of nature experience on cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, and other dimensions of mental health. Then it is shown how ecosystem service assessments can be expanded to include mental health, and provide a heuristic, conceptual model for doing so.

			<h3>Supported by:</h3>
			<strong></strong> <a href="https://sehatvan.in">Sehatvan - Center for Forest Fitness</a> - Bhopal, India <br> 
			<p>The project derived its name by combining an Urdu word ‘sehat’ meaning health with ‘van’, a hindi word meaning ‘forest’. The approach is guided by the Hindi word for healthy - ‘swasth’. Swasth is formed by combining two separate words ‘swa + sthit’, which mean ‘being situated in oneself’. Hence, the emotional dimension of well being/fitness has been an important element in health restoration at Sehatvan.
